# Bloghub Reborn

## Description

Bloghub-Reborn is a full-stack web application that allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. The MERN stack refers to a combination of four powerful technologies that are commonly used to build scalable and dynamic web applications: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

On the front-end, the website is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of a fast and responsive user interface, with real-time updates and data manipulation. The website is also designed to be mobile-responsive, ensuring that it is accessible and easy to use on any device.

On the back-end, the website uses Node.js and Express to create a server that can handle user requests and interact with the MongoDB database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that allows for flexible and scalable data storage, making it a popular choice for web applications.
